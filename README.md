# Sea-Level-Predictor
 This project focuses on analyzing historical sea level data and using it to predict future sea levels through linear regression modeling.  Using real-world data provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the goal is to understand long-term trends in sea level rise and forecast how those levels might change by the year 2050.
